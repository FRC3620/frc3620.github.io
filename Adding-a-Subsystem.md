# Adding a Subsystem
* make a copy of an existing subsystem and rename it to your liking. You will need to fix the class name, the name of the constructor, and the file name (they all need to match). 
* you will need to add the declaration for the new subsystem to RobotContainer.java, and you will need to instantiate the new subsystem inside the robotInit() method in Robot.java.
